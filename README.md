# DevDeck
Shortlisted top 10 Hackathon project at KERALA'S LARGEST HACKATHON -WINTERHACK by IEDC ICET.

ABOUT:-

â€œA WEBSITE WHERE INVESTORS, STARTUPS, AND DEVELOPERS CAN INTERACT!".
The startups can show off their products, others can upvote them, and can put job openings that helps developers to get posted in respective companies. The startups have to add an image of their logo, used later as an NFT. Investors when investing, will be minting the NFT and thus will be able to buy a certain amount for the NFT. The amount will be added to the total raised amount.
The app will be working in the following 3 phases: 
INVESTORS: They can upvote others' ideas or startups based on their interests and will also be able to invest.
STARTUPS: They can publish their company, interact with others and hire developers. 
DEVELOPERS: They can submit their projects and work for like-minded companies. 

The website will enable others to see the most reacted and upvoted startup ideas enabling the startups to get investors and investors will be able to see the most reviewed startups. This will help decrease the number of startup failures and help in finding like-minded people with which they may get a chance to collaborate later.
